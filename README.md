Mastermind

Project description:

Mastermind game is a game where a player has to guess the color pattern consisting of four out of five or six different colors within eight to twelve turns, The number of possible colors and the number of
colors in a pattern can vary depending on the game variations: Each turn player tries to guess the pattern by choosing color pegs and putting them in some order. At the end of the turn, the player receives some hints in the form of a key or hint pegs. For each correctly guessed color and its position, the player gets a hint peg in a certain color (for example green), and for each guessed color but in a wrong position, the player gets a hint peg in some other color (for example yellow). On the next turn, the player should take previous guesses and hints into consideration; The game ends when the player guesses the color pattern correctly, which counts as a win, or when the last turn is reached without correctly guessing the color pattern, which counts as a defeat.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
